<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am a junior at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers University</a> who is double-majoring in <a href="http://www.ece.rutgers.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> and <a href="http://cs.rutgers.edu">Computer Science</a>. My primary academic interests are in artificial intelligence and computer vision, with a strong focus on their application to robotics. As part of my interest in robotics, I am currently serving as the Vice President of Rutgers University's <a href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">IEEE Student Branch</a> and am responsible for the vision system of Rutgers Navigator, our entry into the 2011 <a href="http://www.igvc.org">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a>.</p>

<p>You can read about my contributions to the Rutgers Navigator, my research as part of the <a href="http://rl3.rutgers.edu">Rutgers Real Life Reinforcement Learning Laboratory</a>, and miscellaneous personal projects in the "projects" section of this website.</p>
