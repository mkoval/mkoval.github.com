<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am Michael Koval, a senior at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers
University</a> who is double-majoring in <a
href="http://www.ece.rutgers.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> and
<a href="http://cs.rutgers.edu">Computer Science</a>. My primary academic
interests are in artificial intelligence and computer vision, with a strong
focus on their application to robotics. As part of my interest in robotics, I
am currently serving as the President of Rutgers University's <a
href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">IEEE Student Branch</a> and am responsible for
the vision system of Rutgers Navigator, our entry into the 2011 <a
href="http://www.igvc.org">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a>.</p>

<p>You can read about my contributions to the Rutgers <em>Navigator</em>, my
research as part of the <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/rl3">Rutgers Real
Life Reinforcement Learning Laboratory</a>, and miscellaneous personal projects
in the "projects" section of this website. If you're not sure where to start, I
suggest looking at <a href="/projects/igvc">my work on the Rutgers
Navigator</a> for the 2011 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.</p>

<h2>Robots!</h2>
<p>Thought my involvement with the Rutgers University <a
href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">IEEE Student Branch</a>, I have had the pleasure
of competing in several robotics competitions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2009 Vex Robotics World Championship College Challenge &mdash; <em>Team Leader</em></li>
	<li>2010 Vex Robotics World Championship College Challenge &mdash; <em>Team Leader</em></li>
	<li>2010 BEYA Vex Robotics College Challenge &mdash; <em>Team Leader</em></li>
	<li>2011 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition &mdash; <em>Computer Vision Lead</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes on planned, the 2012 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition will
be shortly joining this list.</p>
