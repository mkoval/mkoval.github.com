<p>NetBots is a novel <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics">swarm robotics</a> algorithm
to improve detection accuracy in the distributed <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_target_recognition">automatic
target recognition</a> (<acronym title="Automatic Target
Recognition">ATR</acronym>) problems. Prior works (Dasgupta <em>et al.</em> and
Martinoli <em>et al.</em>) have applied swarm robotics to the ATR problem by
having a large number of cheap, inaccurate robots "vote" on whether a given
object is a target.</p>

<p>These prior works, however, assume that the host of inexpensive robots is
homogeneous in detection accuracy (i.e. all robots have the same probability of
misidentifying a target). This is an inaccurate assumption: inexpensive
production techniques are error-prone and produce robots of widely varying
accuracy. The NetBots algorithm uses a decentralized social network of robot
interactions to approximate each robots' individual accuracy. With this
additional information, the robots' votes can be weighted to give more accurate
robots greater influence when classifying a potential target.</p>

<p>Both the NetBots and the HelpBots (the naïve control algorithm) were
simulated in the open-source <a
href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/">Stage</a> simulator using custom C++
robot controllers. Initial results show a significant decrease in the number of
errors experienced by the NetBots algorithm when compared to the control
HelpBots algorithm. This research was submitted to the <acronym

Automation">ICRA</acronym> 2010 conference, but was not selected to be
