<h2>Robust Closed-Loop Manipulation via Contact Sensing</h2>

<p>Humans effortlessly manipulate objects in cluttered and uncertain
environments.  In contrast, most robotic manipulators are limited to carefully
engineered environments, e.g. factories, to circumvent the difficulty of
manipulation under uncertainty. Contact sensors can provide robots with with
the feedback vital to addressing this limitation. However, there are three
principal challenges to using contact sensing. First, contact is inherently
discontinuous. Second, contact sensors only provide rich information while in
contact. Third, planning for contact requires reasoning about the physics of
interaction.</p>

<p>Our work addresses these challenges by formulating contact manipulation as a
<em>partially observable Markov decision process</em> (POMDP) in the joint
space of robot configurations and object poses. Policies generated from this
POMDP naturally take information-gathering actions when necessary to complete
the task. For example, the robot may force an object into a contact sensor to
localize it before attempting to push it into the goal region.</p>

<p>We specifically consider the case of quasistatic planar manipulation. We
exploit the structure of the problem to quickly find a near-optimal policy:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre- and Post-Contact Policy Decomposition.</strong> We show that
    the optimal policy naturally decouples into pre- and post-contact stages.
    We present an algorithm that leverages this insight to reuse one
    post-contact policy across multiple problem instances.</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration Lattice.</strong> We perform an online search in a
    lazily-constructed configuration space lattice to guarantee that all
    actions the robot takes are feasible; e.g. do not exceed joint limits,
    violate kinematic reachability constraints, or collide with obstacles.</li>
  <li><strong>Heuristics.</strong> We guide an online search in full state
    space with heuristics derived from relaxations of the problem. For example,
    the optimal policy for an empty environment is a useful heuristic to follow
    when manipulating objects in moderate amounts of clutter.</li>
</ul>

<p>We validate the effiacy of our approach in simulation and real-robot
experiments on HERB, a manipulator with a 7-DOF Barrett WAM arm and the
BarrettHand end-effector. We show that our approach successfully completes the
task more often than baseline algorithms that do not take information-gathering
actions.</p>
