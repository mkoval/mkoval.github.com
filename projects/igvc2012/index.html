<h2>Rutgers Navi, 2012 IGVC</h2>
<p>Navi is a three-wheeled autonomous robot that was designed, built, and programmed by members of Rutgers University’s <a href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">IEEE Student Branch</a>. As the second iteration of the <a href="/projects/igvc2011">Navigator</a>, Rutgers University’s entry into the 2011 IGVC, Navi is the culmination of two years of planning, experience, and testing. It is specifically designed for navigating through unknown, outdoor environments such as those found in the <a href="http://www.igvc.org/">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a> (IGVC). At competition we were a design finalist and placed second of 47 registered teams.</p>

<p>While working on Navi, I developed the <a href="https://github.com/mkoval/FieldforceTCM">fieldforce_tcm</a> ROS driver for <a href="http://www.pnicorp.com/">PNI</a> digital compasses, the <a href="https://github.com/mkoval/jaguar">jaguar</a> ROS driver for the Texas Instuments MDL-BDC24 speed controller, and the <a href="https://github.com/mkoval/robot_kf">robot_kf</a> node for outdoor localization.</p>
