<h2>DARPA Autonomous Robotic Manipulation Project</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-BAA-10-28/listing.html">
  DARPA ARM-S program</a> aimed to develop software to autonomously
complete complex manipulation tasks, As a member of the
<a href="http://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/projects/arms/">CMU/NREC team</a>
for Phase II of the project, I developed manipulation and perception
techniques necessary to complete tasks such as changing a tire or cutting a
wire.</p>

<p>One key challenge of the project was developing techniques to cope with
proprioceptive and perceptual uncertainty. We used a variety of techniques,
including: visual servoing,

  real-time markerless arm tracking</a>,
<a href="http://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=7264">
  touch-based localization</a>,
<a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=7587">
  compliant grasping</a>, and
<a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=7307">
  hierarchies of motion planners</a> to improve reliability.</p>

<p>The software developed by our team powered a live demo in the
<a href="http://airandspace.si.edu/about/newsroom/release/?id=314">
  <em>Moving Beyond Earth</em> gallery</a> of the
<a href="http://airandspace.si.edu/">
  Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum</a>.</p>
