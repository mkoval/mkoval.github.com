<h2>Hardware Abstraction for Vex (HAX)</h2>
<div class="link">Michael Koval and Cody Schafer (<a href="http://github.com/mkoval/hax">Github</a>)</div>
<p>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) being developed by Rutgers' <a href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">IEEE Robotics</a> Vex Division to aid the team's transition from the old PIC-18 based microprocessor to the ARM Cortex M3-based microprocessor. For more detailed information, see the <a href="https://github.com/mkoval/hax/wiki">documentation</a> hosted on the project's Github wiki.</p>

<h2>IR Utilities</h2> 
<div class="author">Michael Koval (<a href="http://github.com/mkoval/ir-utils">Github</a>)</div>

<p><code>ir-utils</code> is a large collection of Python scripts written to collect, parse, and interpret data from a <a href="http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/sharp/sharp.html">Sharp IR Ranger</a> (specifically, the GP2D12 mid-range sensor). These scripts requires <a href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net">pySerial</a> for data collection script (<code>ir-nlines.py</code>), <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org">NumPy</a> for the data interpretation (<code>liveaverage.py</code> and <code>liveinterp.py</code>), and an installation of <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a> in your <code>PATH</code> for live plotting (<code>liveplot.py</code>).</p> 

<p>These scripts are designed to process data in real-time and can be chained together using Unix <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_(Unix)">pipes</a>, allowing for this small collection of scripts to serve a great variety of roles. For example, the following shell command will create a real-time, (mostly) noise-free plot of distance (in centimeters) between the front of the sensor and the nearest obstacle:</p> 

<code class="block">./ir-nlines.py /dev/cu.PL2303-00001004 all \
| ./liveaverage.py mean 10 2 \
| ./liveinterp.py IRCurve.txt 2 \ 
| ./liveplot.py -n500 --min 0 --max 150 1 2</code> 

<p>where <code>/dev/cu.PL2303-00001004</code> is the serial device from which the data is being received and <code>IRCurve.txt</code> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> containing distance &rarr; reading pairs that are representative of the electronic properties of the sensor (i.e. collected during calibration).</p> 

<p>All testing was done on a computer running Mac OS X 10.6 (aka Snow Leopard) using the PIC-18 Vex Microprocessor v1.5 and the official Vex USB-to-Serial programming cable. That being said, all <code>ir-utils</code> scripts are designed to be hardware agnostic and should function identically with any infrared proximity sensor on a Unix-like operating system.</p> 

<h2>NetBots: Swarm Robotics Target Recognition Algorithm</h2> 
<div class="link">Michael Koval, Adina Rubinoff, Mahsa Maghami, and Professor Michael Georgiopolous in the 2009 <acronym title="Advances in Machine Learning in Theory &amp; Applications">AMALTHEA</acronym> <acronym title="Research Experience for Undergraduates">REU</acronym></div>

<p>NetBots is a novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics">swarm robotics</a> algorithm to improve detection accuracy in the distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_target_recognition">automatic target recognition</a> (<acronym title="Automatic Target  Recognition">ATR</acronym>) problems. Prior works (Dasgupta <em>et al.</em> and Martinoli <em>et al.</em>) have applied swarm robotics to the ATR problem by having a large number of cheap, inaccurate robots "vote" on whether a given object is a target.</p> 

<p>These prior works, however, assume that the host of inexpensive robots is homogeneous in detection accuracy (i.e. all robots have the same probability of misidentifying a target). This is an inaccurate assumption: inexpensive production techniques are error-prone and produce robots of widely varying accuracy. The NetBots algorithm uses a decentralized social network of robot interactions to approximate each robots' individual accuracy. With this additional information, the robots' votes can be weighted to give more accurate robots greater influence when classifying a potential target.</p> 

<p>Both the NetBots and the HelpBots (the naïve control algorithm) were simulated in the open-source <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/">Stage</a> simulator using custom C++ robot controllers. Initial results show a significant decrease in the number of errors experienced by the NetBots algorithm when compared to the control HelpBots algorithm. This research was submitted to the <acronym title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</acronym> <acronym title="International Conference on Robotics and Automation">ICRA</acronym>-2010 conference for review.</p>
