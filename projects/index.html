<ul class="projects">
	<li class="project-contact-planning">
    <h3><a href="/projects/contact-planning">
      Robust Manipulation via Contact Sensing</a></h3>
    <p>Robots should autonomously use&mdash;and, when necessary, seek
    out&mdash;feedback from contact sensors to cope with uncertainty. We
    approach this problem by formulating contact manipulation as a stochastic
    process and use belief space planning to generate robust closed-loop
    manipulation policies.

    <h3><a href="/projects/contact-estimation">
      Bayesian State Estimation via Contact Sensing</a></h3>
    <p>Contact sensors are difficult to integrate into traditional Bayesian
    state estimation techniques because they are fundamentally discontinuous.
    We introduce novel state estimation techniques, based on the particle
    filter, that exploit the physics of interaction to address this
    challenge.</p>

    <h3><a href="/projects/herb">
      Planning, Perception, and Control for a Personal Robot</a></h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.cmu.edu/herb-robot/">HERB</a> is a bimanual mobile
    manipulator designed and built by the
    <a href="https://www.personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/">Personal Robotics Lab</a>
    at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> to complete
    household manipulation tasks. As a member of the Personal Robotics Lab, I
    developed many of the planning, perception, and control algorithms used by
    HERB to autonomously manipulate his environment.</p>

	<li class="project-darpa-arm">
    <h3><a href="/projects/darpa-arm">
      DARPA Autonomous Robotic Manipulation Project</a></h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-BAA-10-28/listing.html">
      DARPA ARM-S program</a> aimed to develop software to autonomously
    complete complex manipulation tasks, As a member of the
    <a href="http://www.nrec.ri.cmu.edu/projects/arms/">CMU/NREC team</a>
    for Phase II of the project, I developed manipulation and perception
    techniques necessary to complete tasks such as changing a tire or cutting a
    wire.</p>

<ul class="projects">
	<li class="project-igvc2012">
        <h3><a href="/projects/igvc2012">Navi, Entry to the 2012 IGVC</a></h3>
        <p>The 20<sup>th</sup> Annual <a href="http://www.igvc.org">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a> (IGVC)
        was Rutgers University's second year of competing in IGVC. We entered with Navi, an entirely redesigned version
        of the earlier Navigator. As the team leader and primary software developer, I was responsible for Navi's
        localization, perception, and planning.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="project-igvc2011">
		<h3><a href="/projects/igvc2011">Navigator, Entry to the 2011 IGVC</a></h3>
		<p>The 19<sup>th</sup> Annual <a href="http://www.igvc.org">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a> (IGVC) marked Rutgers University's rookie year of competing in IGVC and the completion of the <em>Navigator</em>. As vision lead, I was responsible for developing the <em>Navigator</em>'s custom trinocular stereo vision, obstacle detection, and lane tracking systems.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="project-quadrotor">
        <h3><a href="/projects/quadrotor">Policy Search for Control of a Quadrotor Helicopter</a></h3> <p>Policy search
        is a branch of reinforcement learning that has yielded promising results for problems with a high-dimensional
        state-action space. This is especially true in robotics, where sensor readings and actuator controls are both
        continuous. Over the period of a year, I researched the application of policy search to the control of an
        autonomous quadrotor helicopter with <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/rl3">RL3</a> and advisor <a
        href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mlittman/">Dr. Michael Littman</a>.</p> </li>
	<li class="project-netbots">
		<h3><a href="/projects/netbots">NetBots: Swarm Robotics Target Recognition</a></h3>
		<p>NetBots is a novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics">swarm robotics</a> algorithm to improve detection accuracy in the distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_target_recognition">automatic target recognition</a> (<acronym title="Automatic Target  Recognition">ATR</acronym>) problems. Prior work (Dasgupta <em>et al.</em> and Martinoli <em>et al.</em>) have applied swarm robotics to the ATR problem by having a large number of cheap, inaccurate robots "vote" on whether a given object is a target.</p> 
	</li>
	<li class="project-hax">
		<h3><a href="/projects/hax">Hardware Abstraction for Vex (HAX)</a></h3>
		<p>HAX is a hardware abstraction layer that provides a common interface to the <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/products/accessories/logic/276-2170.html">Vex PIC Microcontroller</a> and <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/products/accessories/logic/276-2194.html">Vex Cortex Microcontroller</a>. Any code that interfaces with hardware through HAX can seamlessly run on the PIC and ARM architectures with minimal changes.</p>
