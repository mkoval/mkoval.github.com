		<h3><a href="/projects/igvc">Rutgers Navigator, Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a></h3>
		<p>The 19<sup>th</sup> Annual <a href="http://www.igvc.org">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a> (IGVC) marked Rutgers University's rookie year of competing in IGVC and the completion of the <em>Navigator</em>. As vision lead, I was responsible for developing the <em>Navigator</em>'s custom trinocular stereo vision, obstacle detection, and lane tracking systems. For the upcoming 20<sup>th</sup> IGVC I will be serving as team lead.</p>

		<h3><a href="/projects/quadrotor">Policy Search for Control of a Quadrotor Helicopter</a></h3>
		<p>Policy search is a branch of reinforcement learning that has yielded promising results for problems with a high-dimensional state-action space. This is especially true in robotics, where sensor readings and actuator controls are both continuous. Over the period of a year, I researched the application of policy search to the control of an autonomous quadrotor helicopter with the <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/rl3">Rutgers Laborator for Real-life Reinforcement Learning</a> (RL<sup>3</sup>) and advisor <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mlittman/">Dr. Michael Littman</a>.</p>

		<h3><a href="/projects/netbots">NetBots: Swarm Robotics Target Recognition</a></h3>
		<p>NetBots is a novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics">swarm robotics</a> algorithm to improve detection accuracy in the distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_target_recognition">automatic target recognition</a> (<acronym title="Automatic Target  Recognition">ATR</acronym>) problems. Prior work (Dasgupta <em>et al.</em> and Martinoli <em>et al.</em>) have applied swarm robotics to the ATR problem by having a large number of cheap, inaccurate robots "vote" on whether a given object is a target.</p>

		<h3><a href="/projects/hax">Hardware Abstraction for Vex (HAX)</a></h3>
		<p>HAX is a hardware abstraction layer that provides a common interface to the <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/products/accessories/logic/276-2170.html">Vex PIC Microcontroller</a> and <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/products/accessories/logic/276-2194.html">Vex Cortex Microcontroller</a>. Any code that interfaces with hardware through HAX can seamlessly run on the PIC and ARM architectures with minimal changes.</p>
