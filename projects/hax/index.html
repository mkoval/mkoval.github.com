<h2>Hardware Abstraction for Vex</h2>

<p>Heading into the 2010 Vex Robotics Competition season, our team heard some
great news: we were being issued a pre-release beta of the Vex Cortex
Microcontroller based on the the ARM Cortex processor, Compared to the original
Vex Microcontroller V0.5, which was based on a PIC18 processor, the new
microcontroller was blazing fast and used an architecture that has a
full-featured open-soruce toolchain. Unfortunately, the new microcontroller
would not be available a scant few months before the World Championship.</p>

<p>This was a daunting problem. With the new microcontroller arriving so late
it was very unlikely that we would have time to port and test our competition
code to the new architecture. Instead, we decided to design a hardware
abstraction layer that serves as a layer of indirection between the high-level
user-code and low-level hardware access. As long as our programs only
interacted with the hardware through this abstraction layer, the same code
could be easily modified to run on both platforms.</p>

<p>Following the lessons learned from this first attempt at a easy-to-use C
programming layer for Vex mircocontrollers, the programming team refined the
design over the summer, leading to the new and improved HAX. The team plans to
use this updated version of HAX in the 2010 VEX World Championships, as well
any other other competitions on the way to Dallas.</p>
